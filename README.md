# Open-School
*An open-sourced learning system (**LMS**) that offers courses ranging from Pre-K through college-level learning levels.*

## Concept
**As a proctor**, I'd like to be able to create a course that is completely self guided so that others may consume it without input from myself or another proctor.

**As a student**, I'd like to choose a course or recommended set of courses that I can consume at my own pace that I know have been exhaustively peer reviewed.

Proctors can utilize resources available to create a complete self-guided course that is hosted with GitHub so that others can peer review the course and make edits/additions as they see fit. 

## Features

 - **Central Web Portal** (**GitHub Pages**; convenient for forking)
